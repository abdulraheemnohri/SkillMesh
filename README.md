SkillMesh is a fully decentralized professional task network that connects users posting tasks with local professionals (Electricians, Plumbers, Tutors, etc.) using a P2P mesh network.

The ecosystem consists of two variants:
1.  **Professional Node (Pro Dashboard):** For service providers (electricians, plumbers, etc.) to host the mesh and manage tasks.
2.  **User Client (HTML App):** A lightweight standalone app for normal users to post tasks and track status.

## 🚀 Features

- **Decentralized Architecture:** No central server; tasks sync directly between professional nodes.
- **Dual-App Ecosystem:** Optimized UI for both professionals (full dashboard) and users (simplified posting).
- **Mesh Heartbeat & Discovery:** See online professionals and network status in real-time.
- **P2P Sync & Conflict Resolution:** Built on `libp2p` with "First-Claim-Wins" logic.
- **P2P Chat System:** Real-time mesh-synced chat for task coordination.
- **Private Contact Reveal:** Mobile numbers are hidden during broadcast and only revealed to the claimer.
- **Multi-Location Filtering:** Filter tasks by Country, City, and Specific Area.
- **Project Deadlines:** Specify "Need by" dates for tasks.
- **Reputation System:** Professionals earn points and level up (Beginner to Expert).
- **Donation Ready:** Integrated Crypto (MetaMask) and Bank payment options.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. The Professional Node (Gateway)
Professionals install this to participate in the mesh and provide a gateway for users.

**Desktop / Laptop:**
1.  Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+).
2.  Navigate to `professional-node/` and run `npm install`.
3.  Start the node: `node node.js`.
4.  Access dashboard: `http://localhost:3000`.

**Android (via Termux):**
1.  `pkg update && pkg install nodejs git`.
2.  `cd professional-node && npm install`.
3.  `node node.js`.

---

### 2. The User Client (Mobile / Standalone)
Normal users open this to post tasks. It can be hosted as a **GitHub Static Page** or used as a local HTML app.

1.  **Host on GitHub:** Upload the `client-app/` folder to a GitHub repository and enable **GitHub Pages** in settings.
2.  **Open App:** Access the live URL or open `client-app/index.html` locally.
3.  **Configure Node:** Click the ⚙️ (Settings) icon.
4.  **Set Node URL:** Enter the IP/URL of a running Professional Node (e.g., `http://your-node-ip:3000`).
5.  **Post Task:** Fill the form including **Mobile Number** and **Deadline**.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Mesh Connectivity
Professional nodes form a mesh using **mDNS** (local) and **PubSub**. They act as "gateways" for user clients. When a user posts a task to a node, that node broadcasts it to all other peers in the mesh.

### Conflict Resolution
If two professionals claim the same task at the same time, SkillMesh uses **Timestamp-based Priority**. The claim with the earlier `assignedAt` timestamp is accepted by the network, ensuring a single professional is assigned.

### Reputation & Stats
Professionals earn **10 points** per completed task.
- **0-19 pts:** Beginner
- **20-49 pts:** Intermediate
- **50-99 pts:** Pro
- **100+ pts:** Expert

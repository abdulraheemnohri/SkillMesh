# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the latest version of SkillMesh is supported for security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead, report it via [INSERT METHOD/EMAIL].

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix. Public disclosure will only happen after a fix is released and users have had time to update.

## Decentralized Security
As SkillMesh is a P2P network, please be aware that you are responsible for the security of your own node and private keys.
